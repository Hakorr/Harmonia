# Harmonia (Mobile-Friendly Spotify)

Makes Spotify's desktop layout more user-friendly on mobile. Tablets might not be supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Tested with the [Quetta](https://www.quetta.net/) browser. *Psst*, it also blocks ads, ad-free Spotify experience for mobile without modded APKs.

> [!WARNING]
> Expect bugs. Spotify might change their site layout at any moment, breaking Harmonia completely.
